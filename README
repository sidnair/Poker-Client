I started this a long time ago when I had very little experience, so this code
is pretty bad. Starting work on refactoring it.

Known issues:
	- Disconnects may not be handled gracefully
  - Must make sure it works for more than two players (all-in situations)
	- Window size is not scalable

How to run:
	-compile with javac *.java
	-start server with: java GameServer port
	-start client(s) with: java Lobby; fill in appropriate options from GUI
