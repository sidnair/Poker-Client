Status: I haven't worked on this project for a while since I've been busy with work, but I've finally gotten around to uploading it. The game should work for heads up play (two players). The code is a little messy since I coded most of this a long time ago when I had less experience.

Known issues:
	-There is an issue calculating pot size for pots with more than two people all-in
	-Disconnects may not be handled gracefully

Desired Features:
	-Fix for more than two players
	-Make window size scalable

How to run:
	-compile with javac *.java
	-start server with: java GameServer port
	-start client(s) with: java Lobby; fill in appropriate options from GUI
